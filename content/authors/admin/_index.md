Hey there, I'm Victor, a postdoctoral researcher in the [Dynamic Macroecology Group](https://www.wsl.ch/de/ueber-die-wsl/organisation/forschungseinheiten/landschaftsdynamik/dynamische-makrooekologie/) at the [Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape (WSL)](https://www.wsl.ch/en/index.html), Switzerland.
<br>

I am an interdisciplinary scientist specializing in **biomathematics**, **scientific computing**, and **machine learning** with applications for **environmental sciences**.
I am especially interested in **hybrid methods** that combine the extrapolation capabilities of process-based models with the flexibility of machine learning techniques. My main domain of application is **ecology**, although the solutions I develop often extend beyond this field.
<br>

Outside of work, I am a part-time alpinist, passionate about mountain adventures and writing. I also enjoy sailing and surfing occasionally. You can check out **my alpine CV** [here]({{<ref "/pages/alpine_cv.md" >}}).
